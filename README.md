## Plantify- A shopping app made using React Native.

This is the UI prototype of Plantify- A shopping app made using React Native. This was me, first time using react-native. So, I decided to practice by creating a Plant-Selling App prototype.

## Prototype Images

## Tech Stack Used
 
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started "React Native") is used for creating the UI of the App.
    * [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/ "Expo") client is used for quick setting up of the App.
   
* [React Navigation - v5](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started "React Navigation - v5") is used for navigating between different screens.
